### **Epic 1: Core Data Structures**

#### User Story: "As a developer, I need efficient in-memory data structures to store tables and rows."

1. **Task:** Define a basic `Row` structure to hold key-value pairs for data.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** A `Row` object can store key-value pairs dynamically.
2. **Task:** Create a `Table` class to manage rows using a primary key.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Insert, update, and retrieve rows using the primary key.
3. **Task:** Implement serialization and deserialization for tables (optional for initial sprints).
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** A `Table` object can be serialized into a string and reconstructed.

### **Epic 2: Query Engine**

#### User Story: "As a user, I want to run queries on the database so that I can retrieve data efficiently."

1. **Task:** Implement `SELECT` query functionality for single-row lookups by key.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Query engine retrieves a row by its primary key.
2. **Task:** Implement `INSERT` query functionality to add new rows to a table.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Query engine inserts new rows successfully.
3. **Task:** Create support for filtering data based on specific columns.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** A query can filter rows using column values.
4. **Task:** Add support for `DELETE` queries to remove rows.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can delete rows by their primary key.

### **Epic 3: Indexing and Optimization**

#### User Story: "As a user, I want the system to adapt to frequent queries and optimize performance."

1. **Task:** Create a basic indexing mechanism for a single column.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** The database creates an index for one column and uses it to speed up lookups.
2. **Task:** Implement auto-indexing based on query patterns.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Frequently queried columns are indexed automatically.
3. **Task:** Integrate indexes into the query engine.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Query engine uses indexes to optimize query execution.

### **Epic 4: Memory Management**

#### User Story: "As a developer, I need the system to manage memory efficiently to handle large datasets."

1. **Task:** Implement dynamic resizing for data structures.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Data structures grow/shrink based on data size.
2. **Task:** Add memory usage monitoring for tables and rows.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system reports memory usage stats.
3. **Task:** Design an eviction policy for memory-heavy operations (e.g., LRU).
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system can evict unused or stale data to free memory.

---

### **Epic 5: Persistence and Recovery**

#### User Story: "As a user, I want the data to persist between server restarts so that no information is lost."

1. **Task:** Implement data persistence for tables (e.g., saving to a file).
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Tables can be saved to disk and reloaded.
2. **Task:** Create a checkpoint mechanism to periodically save data.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system saves the state at intervals.
3. **Task:** Implement recovery logic to reload data from the last checkpoint.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system recovers data on restart.

---

### **Epic 6: Concurrency and Transactions**

#### User Story: "As a user, I want the system to handle multiple operations simultaneously and ensure data consistency."

1. **Task:** Design a basic locking mechanism for row-level locking.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Only one transaction can modify a row at a time.
2. **Task:** Implement transaction management with rollback support.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Transactions can commit or rollback changes.
3. **Task:** Add support for concurrent queries using multithreading.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Multiple read queries can execute concurrently.

---

### **Epic 7: Adaptive Tuning**

#### User Story: "As a user, I want the system to dynamically optimize itself for performance based on query patterns."

1. **Task:** Build query statistics collection (e.g., frequency of column usage).
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system tracks query patterns in real-time.
2. **Task:** Implement dynamic tuning for indexes based on statistics.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system creates/drops indexes dynamically.
3. **Task:** Integrate query result caching.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Frequently executed queries return results faster via caching.

---

### **Epic 8: Monitoring and Metrics**

#### User Story: "As a developer, I want to monitor system performance to ensure it is functioning optimally."

1. **Task:** Add logging for query execution times.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Query execution times are logged.
2. **Task:** Implement metrics collection (e.g., memory usage, query counts).
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Metrics are collected and displayed.
3. **Task:** Create a simple CLI dashboard to show metrics in real time.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can view metrics via a command-line interface.

---

### **Epic 9: Testing and Deployment**

#### User Story: "As a developer, I want to test the system thoroughly to ensure reliability."

1. **Task:** Write unit tests for core data structures.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** All core structures pass unit tests.
2. **Task:** Write integration tests for the query engine.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** Queries execute correctly end-to-end.
3. **Task:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
   * **Acceptance Criteria:** All tests run automatically on code changes.
